From the title song's regal blasts of brass and fuzz guitar to the orchestral seizure and long, dying piano chord at the end of \"A Day in the Life,\" the 13 tracks on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are the pinnacle of the Beatles' eight years as recording artists. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were never more fearless and unified in their pursuit of magic and transcendence."

The Beatles made a point of echoing them on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - an acknowledgment that Pet Sounds was the inspiration for the Beatles' masterpiece. That gesture actually completed a circle of influence: Wilson initially  conceived of Pet Sounds as an effort to top the Beatles' Rubber Soul."

But inside the deliberately dense squall - Richards'  and Mick Taylor's dogfight riffing, the lusty jump of the Bill Wyman-Charlie Watts rhythm engine, Mick Jagger's caged-animal bark and burned-soul croon - is the Stones' greatest album and Jagger and Richards' definitive songwriting statement of outlaw pride and dedication to grit. In the existential shuffle \"Tumbling Dice,\" the exhausted country beauty \"Torn and Frayed\" and the whiskey-soaked uplift of \"Shine a Light,\" you literally hear the Stones in exile: working at Richards' villa in the South of France, and on the run from media censure, British drug police (Jagger and Richards already knew the view from behind bars) and the country's onerous tax code. Exile is rife with allusions to their outsider status: The album's cover is a collage of freakish American characters, and on \"Sweet Black Angel\" they toast imprisoned activist Angela Davis - one set of renegades to another. The music rattles like battle but also swings with clear purpose on songs like \"Rocks Off\" and \"All Down the Line.\" As Richards explained, \"The Stones don't have a home anymore - hence the Exile - but they can still keep it together. Whatever people throw at us, we can still duck, improvise, overcome.\" Great example: Richards recorded his jubilant romp \"Happy\" with just producer Jimmy Miller on drums and saxman Bobby Keys - while waiting for the other Stones to turn up for work. Exile on Main Street is the Stones at their fighting best, armed with the blues, playing to win."

Produced with no-surrender energy by legendary Seventies studio madman Guy Stevens, the Clash's third album skids from bleak punk (\"London Calling\") to rampaging ska (\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\") and disco resignation (\"Lost in the Supermarket\"). The album was made in dire straits too. The band was heavily in debt and openly at war with its record company. Singer-guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones wrote together in Jones' grandmother's flat. \"Joe, once he learned how to type, would bang the lyrics out,\" Jones said. \"Then I'd be able to bang out some music while he was hitting the typewriter.\" Strummer, Jones, bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Topper Headon spent nearly three months rehearsing and demoing songs in a garage in the Pimlico section of London - \"with one light and filthy carpet on the walls for soundproofing,\" recalled Strummer in 1989. \"We felt that we were struggling,\" he said, \"about to slide down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails.\" But Stevens was on hand for inspiration. He threw chairs around the room \"if he thought a track needed zapping up,\" according to Strummer. The album ends with \"Train in Vain,\" a rousing song of fidelity (unlisted on the back cover because it was added at the last minute) that became the sound of triumph: the Clash's first Top 30 single in the U.S."

After several false-start sessions in New York in the fall of 1965 and January 1966 with his killer road band the Hawks - \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\" was the only keeper - Dylan blazed through the rest of Blonde on Blonde's 14 tracks in one four-day run and one three-day run at Columbia's Nashville studios in February and March 1966."

Yet the creative tension resulted in one of the most intense and adventurous rock albums ever made. Lennon pursued his hard-edged vision into the cynical wit of \"Sexy Sadie\" and \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun,\" but also infused \"Julia\" and \"Dear Prudence\" with childlike yearning. Paul McCartney's playful pop energy came through on his inversion of Chuck Berry's American values, \"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\" and he showed off his raucous side in \"Helter Skelter.\" Harrison's spiritual yearning led him to \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" featuring a guest guitar solo from Eric Clapton. Even Starr contributed his first original, the country-tinged \"Don't Pass Me By.\" \"I think it was a very good album,\" said McCartney. \"It stood up, but it wasn't a pleasant one to make.\""

Elvis Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black were horsing around with \"That's All Right, Mama,\" a tune by bluesman Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, when producer Sam Phillips stopped them and asked, \"What are you doing?\" \"We don't know,\" they said. Phillips told them to \"back up and do it again.\" The A side of Presley's first single (backed with a version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\"), \"That's All Right\" was issued by Sun on July 19th. It may or may not be the first rock & roll record. But the man who would be King was officially on wax. Bridging black and white, country and blues, his sound was playful and revolutionary, charged by a spontaneity and freedom that changed the world. \"It's the blues,\" critic Greil Marcus wrote in his classic book Mystery Train. \"But free of all worry, all sin; a simple joy with no price to pay.\" Presley released four more singles on Sun - including definitive reinventions of Wynonie Harris' \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" and Junior Parker's \"Mystery Train\" - before moving on to immortality when Phillips sold his contract to RCA for $35,000. Incredibly, it took more than 20 years for Presley's Sun output to be properly collected on a 1976 LP - which has since been superseded by this 1999 double-CD chronicle of the King's beginnings at Sun. It collects everything he cut at the studio, including alternate takes and the 1953 acetate he recorded as a gift for his mother as a shy and awkward recent high school graduate."

    "summary": "This painterly masterpiece would become one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz. But at the time it was made, Kind of Blue was a revolution all its own, a radical break from everything going on. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation - breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in the thick of hard bop. Davis and his peerless band - bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley - soloed in uncluttered settings, typified by \"melodic rather than harmonic variation,\" as Davis put it. Two numbers, \"All Blues\" and \"Freddie Freeloader\" (the latter featured Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), were in 12-bar form, but Davis' approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom. Evans wrote in his original liner notes, \"Miles conceived these settings only hours before the recording dates and arrived with sketches which indicated to the group what was to be played. Therefore, you will hear something close to pure spontaneity in these performances.\" Or as the late critic Robert Palmer wrote, \"Kind of Blue is, in a sense, all melody - and atmosphere.\" The bass line in \"So What\" is now among the most familiar obbligatos in jazz, and there is no finer evocation of the late-night wonder of jazz than the muted horns in \"All Blues.\""

    "summary": "\"We were trying to do a Phil Spector thing with as few instruments as possible,\" John Cale, the classically trained pianist and viola player of the Velvet Underground, said of this record. It was no idle boast. Much of what we take for granted in rock would not exist without this New York band or its seminal debut: the androgynous sexuality of glitter; punk's raw noir; the blackened-riff howl of grunge and noise rock; goth's imperious gloom. Recorded dirt-cheap at a studio that was literally falling apart, it is a record of fearless breadth and lyric depth. Singer-songwriter Lou Reed documented carnal desire and drug addiction, decadence and redemption, with a pop wisdom he learned as a song-factory composer for Pickwick Records. Cale introduced the power of pulse and drone (from his work with minimalist composer La Monte Young); guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played with tribal force; Nico, a German vocalist added to the band by manager Andy Warhol, brought an icy femininity to the heated ennui in Reed's songs. Rejected as nihilistic by the love crowd in '67, the Banana Album (so named for its Warhol-designed cover) is the most prophetic rock album ever made."

That January, the Beatles were on the verge of a breakup, exhausted and angry with one another after the disastrous sessions for the aborted Get Back LP, later salvaged as Let It Be [see No. 392]. Determined to go out with a sense of recaptured glory, the group reconvened at EMI's Abbey Road Studios to make its most polished album: a collection of superb songs cut with an attention to refined detail, then segued together (especially on Side Two) with conceptual force. There was no thematic link, other than the Beatles' unique genius. John Lennon veered from the stormy metal of \"I\u2008Want You (She's So Heavy)\" to the exquisite vocal sunrise of \"Because.\" Paul McCartney was saucy (\"Oh! Darling\"), silly (\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\") and deliciously bitter (\"You Never Give Me Your Money\"). George Harrison proved his long-secret worth as a composer with \"Something\"\u2008and the folk-pop diamond \"Here Comes the Sun,\" written in his friend Eric Clapton's garden while playing hooky from a business meeting. And Lennon, McCartney and Harrison reputedly sang more three-part harmony here than on any other Beatles album. Let It Be was the group's final release, but this album was its real goodbye."

Hendrix's incendiary playing was historic in itself, the luminescent sum of his chitlin-circuit labors in the early Sixties with Little Richard and the Isley Brothers and his melodic exploitation of amp howl. But it was the pictorial heat of songs like \"Manic Depression,\" \"I Don't Live Today\"\u2008and \"The Wind Cries Mary\" that established the transcendent promise of psychedelia. Hendrix made soul music for inner space. \"It's a collection of free feeling and imagination,\" he said of the album. \"Imagination is very important.\" Widely assumed to be about an acid trip, \"Purple Haze\" had \"nothing to do with drugs,\" Hendrix insisted. \"'Purple Haze' was all about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.\""

It was, for him, a pointed reference to the personal crisis - the collapse of his marriage to Sara Lowndes - that at least partly inspired this album, Dylan's best of the 1970s. In fact, he wrote all of these lyrically piercing, gingerly majestic songs in two months, in mid-1974. He was so proud of them that he privately auditioned almost all of the album, from start to finish, for pals and peers including Mike Bloomfield, David Crosby and Graham Nash before cutting them in September - in just a week, with members of the bluegrass band Deliverance. But in December, Dylan played the record for his brother David in Minneapolis, who suggested recutting some songs with local musicians. The final Blood was a mix of the slow, pensive New York sessions and the faster, wilder Minneapolis dates. Together, they frame the gritty anguish in some of Dylan's most passionate, confessional songs - from adult breakup ballads like \"If You See Her, Say Hello\" to the sharp-tongued opprobrium of \"Idiot Wind,\" his greatest put-down song since \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" \"It's hard for me to relate to people enjoying that type of pain,\" Dylan said after the album became an instant success. Yet he had never turned so much pain into so much musical splendor."

No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation - a nation of teens suddenly turned punk - and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of fame led already troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain to take his own life in 1994. But his slashing riffs, corrosive singing and deviously oblique writing, rammed home by the Pixies-via-Zeppelin might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, put the warrior purity back in rock & roll. Lyrically, Cobain raged in code - shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing. His genius, though, in songs like \"Lithium,\" \"Breed\" and \"Teen Spirit\" was the soft-loud tension he created between verse and chorus, restraint and assault. Cobain was a pop lover at heart - and a Beatlemaniac: Nevermind producer Butch Vig remembers hearing Cobain play John Lennon's \"Julia\" at sessions. Cobain also fought to maintain his underground honor. Ultimately, it was a losing battle, but it is part of this album's enduring power. Vig recalls when Cobain was forced to overdub the guitar intro to \"Teen Spirit\" because he couldn't nail it live with the band:\u2008\"That pissed him off.

He found it so hard to re-create the sound in his head - the Jersey-bar dynamite of his live gigs, Phil Spector's grandeur, Roy Orbison's melodrama - that he nearly gave up and put out a live album. But his attention to detail produced a timeless record about the labors and glories of aspiring to greatness."

Fresh off the success of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and newly signed to artistfriendly Warner Bros., he explored the physical and dramatic range of his voice during extended poetic-scat singing, and set hallucinatory reveries on his native Belfast to wandering Celtic-R&B melodies. The crowning touch was the superior jazz quintet convened by producer Lewis Merenstein to color the mists and shadows. Bassist Richard Davis later said that Morrison never told the musicians what he wanted from them or what the lyrics meant. Maybe he didn't know how to. He was going deep inside himself, without a net or fear."

On Thriller, the child R&B star ripened into a Technicolor soulman: a singer, dancer and songwriter with incomparable crossover instincts. He and producer Quincy Jones established the something-for-everyone template with 1979's Off the Wall, a crisp fusion of pop hooks and dance beats. On Thriller, the pair heighten the sheen (\"The Girl Is Mine\"), pump up the theater (\"Thriller\") and deepen the funk. But the most thrilling thing was the autobiography busting through the gloss: the hiss of denial on \"Billie Jean\"; the to-hell-with-haters strut of \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.\" Jackson was at the peak of his art and adulthood."

In the maestro's own words, \"The nature and backbone of my beat is boogie, and the muscle of my music is melodies that are simple.\" This collection culls the best of that magic from 1955 to 1965."

Lennon attacks and denies idols and icons, including his own former band (\"I don't believe in Beatles,\" he sings in \"God\"), to hit a pure, raw core of confession that, in its echo-drenched, garage-rock crudity, is years ahead of punk. He deals with childhood loss in \"Mother\" and skirts blasphemy in \"Working Class Hero\": \"You're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.\" But consigning Sixties dreams to the rubbish bin, there's also room for a fragile sense of possibility (see \"Hold On\"). Plastic Ono Band is the sound of Year Zero."

Fusing social realism with spiritual idealism, he brings expressive color and irresistible funk to his keyboards on \"Too High\" (a cautionary anti-drug song) and \"Higher Ground\" (which echoes Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of transcendence). The album's centerpiece is \"Living for the City,\" a cinematic depiction of exploitation and injustice. He brought his most innovative music to life in the nick of time: Three days after Innervisions was released, Wonder was put into a four-day coma after the car he was traveling in collided with a logging truck."

Yet the template for everything Zeppelin achieved in the 1970s is here: brutal rock (\"Communication Breakdown\"), thundering power balladry (\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\"), acid-flavored folk blues (\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\").

Stephen Stills and James Taylor lend an occasional hand, but in \"California,\" \"Carey,\" \"This Flight Tonight\" and the devastating title track, Mitchell sounds utterly alone in her melancholy, turning the sadness into tender, universally powerful art."

And for good reason: The third record by his biracial L.A. band is wild and funny and totally pioneering: folk rock turned into elegant Armageddon with the symphonic sweep and mariachi-brass drama of \"Alone Again Or\" and \"You Set the Scene.\" In the late Nineties, Lee served time in prison. After his release, he brought extra pathos to \"Live and Let Live\" when he sang, \"Served my time, served it well.\""

    "summary": "Jimi Hendrix's first album remade rock & roll with guitar magic that no one had ever dreamed of; his second album had even more sorcery. It started with some musings on extraterrestrial life, then got really far-out: jazzy drumming, funky balladry, liquid guitar solos, dragonfly heavy metal and the immortal stoner's maxim from \"If 6 Was 9\": \"I'm the one who's gonna have to die when it's time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to.\" All over the album, Hendrix was inventing new ways to make the electric guitar roar, sing, talk, shriek, flutter and fly. And with the delicate \"Little Wing,\" he delivered one of rock's most cryptic and bewitching love songs."

The Detroitborn preacher's daughter was about $80,000 in debt to her previous label, Columbia - where she had recorded a series of somewhat tame early-Sixties albums - when Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler signed her in 1966. \"I took her to church,\" Wexler said, \"sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself.\" She immediately cut the album's title hit, a slow fire of ferocious sexuality, while her storefrontchurch cover of Otis Redding's \"Respect\" - Franklin's first Number One pop single - became the marching song for the women's and civil rights movements."

But Franklin channeled that frenzy into performances of funky pride and magisterial hurt. Among the best: the grand-prayer treatment of Curtis Mayfield's \"People Get Ready,\" the revved-up longing of \"Since You've Been Gone (Sweet Sweet Baby)\" and her explosive anguish on the hit cover of Don Covay's \"Chain of Fools.\""

The immortal force of the album is in Springsteen's frank mix of soaring optimism and the feeling of, as he put it, being \"handcuffed to the bumper of a state trooper's Ford.\""

As the band played arenas in 1977, bassistlyricist Roger Waters first hit upon the wall as a metaphor for isolation and rebellion. He finished a demo of the work by July 1978; the double album then took the band a year to make. Rock's ultimate self-pity opera, The Wall is also hypnotic in its indulgence: the totalitarian thunder of \"In the Flesh?,\" the suicidal languor of \"Comfortably Numb,\" the Brechtian drama of \"The Trial\" and the anti-institutional spleen of the album's unshakable disco hit, \"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2.\" Rock-star hubris has never been more electrifying."

But At Folsom Prison is essential Cash. Backed by his tough touring band, including fellow Sun Records alum Carl Perkins on guitar, Cash guffaws his way through \"Cocaine Blues,\" \"25 Minutes to Go\" (a countdown to an execution) and \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" with its line about shooting a man just to watch him die.

Talking Book was full of introspection and social commentary, with Wonder producing, writing and playing most of the instruments himself.
